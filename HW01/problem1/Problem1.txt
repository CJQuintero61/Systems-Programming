# This part of the assignment asks us to read segfault.cpp and 
# determine why the code throws a segmentation fault.


Explain why segfault.cpp causes a segmentation fault.

A segmentatin fault occurrs with the b pointer because

	int* b;
	setint(b, 10);
    
these lines define a pointer to an integer called b.
The b pointer is uninitialized and therefore points to a random address.
This then calls the function which assigns the random address that b points to 
and assigns 10 to it. This can cause a segmentation fault because we are trying to assign
a value to some random address.
